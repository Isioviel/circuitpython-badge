Accelerometer
*****************

There is a LIS3DH accelerometer in the middle of the board, under the display,
which can be used to read the position and movement of the device. It is also
connected over an IÂ²C protocol to the ``board.SDA0`` and ``board.SCL0`` pins.
It can be accessed with the ``badge.accel()`` function.
